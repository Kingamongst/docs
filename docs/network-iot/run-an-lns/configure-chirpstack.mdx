[ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) is an open-source, multi-tenant LoRaWAN Network Server
(LNS) that provides a web console and gRPC API for managing devices, routing messages, and
interacting with major cloud providers.

## Getting Started

Before beginning, make sure to have the following:

- Helium Config Service CLI with delegate keypair
- Helium Network Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
- Helium LoRaWAN devAddr slab
- Data Credits (>3.5M DC)

## Docker Compose and Kubernetes

Detailed discussion is provided for running ChirpStack on both Docker Compose and Kubernetes. While 
both can be used in a variety of settings, the configurations provided in the documentation here 
describe using Docker Compose to run ChirpStack in a non-production setting and using Kubernetes to
run ChirpStack in a production setting.
